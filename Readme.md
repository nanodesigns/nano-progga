###Licenses

####Code License
I always respect my first WordPress theme teacher [Ian Stewart](http://themeshaper.com/author/superuser/) for his excellent brief on my first theme. I then tried many and learn more with the help of WordPress developers at [WordPress Development community](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com). But with their assistance and guidance, the theme was completely developed by **nano**designs

Third party libraries are used:

* Bootstrap 3.3.4
* _s Starter Theme
* `wp_bootstrap_navwalker` class by *Edward McIntyre*
* Modernizr
* Masonry
* Codestar Framework by Codestar

####Design License
The layout design was totally made by **nano**designs. The license for the design is as same as the theme itself.

####Font License
The nano progga theme used Siyam Rupali for Bengali. The font is embeded with the theme so it won't load from any third party sources.

* Siyam Rupali is an Open Source Font [available in Github](https://github.com/potasiyam/Siyam-Rupali‎)

nano progga icon font is generated combining various fonts using online app: [Fontastic.me](http://fontastic.me/).

###Installation
