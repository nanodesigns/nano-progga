###Introduction

###Description

nano progga is a search engine optimized blog framework, especially designed for blogging in Bengali (*Bānglā*) using WordPress. It supports custom header, custom menu, sidebar widget area (one specifically for archive pages), and unlimited plugins. It is optimized specially for Bengali (*Bānglā*) blogging, with speed and less weight. But the theme is completely translation-ready and can be translated into any locals.

nano progga theme is specially made for blogging in Bengali (*Bānglā*). A complete responsive theme. With sticky post facility user can stick a post or a couple of posts at the top of all the posts.

###Licenses

####Code License
I always respect my first WordPress theme teacher [Ian Stewart](http://themeshaper.com/author/superuser/) for his excellent brief on my first theme. I then tried many and learn more with the help of WordPress developers at [WordPress Development community](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com). But with their assistance and guidance, the theme was completely developed by **nano**designs

Third party libraries are used:

* Bootstrap 3.3.4
* _s Starter Theme
* `wp_bootstrap_navwalker` class by *Edward McIntyre*
* Modernizr
* Masonry

####Design License
The layout design was totally made by **nano**designs. The license for the design is as same as the theme itself.

####Font License
The nano progga theme used Siyam Rupali for Bengali. The font is embeded with the theme so it won't load from any third party sources.

* Siyam Rupali is an Open Source Font [available in Github](https://github.com/potasiyam/Siyam-Rupali‎)

nano progga icon font is generated combining various fonts using online app: [Fontastic.me](http://fontastic.me/).

###Installation
	
1. In your admin panel, go to `Appearance` &raquo; `Themes` and click the <kbd>Add New</kbd> button.
2. Click `Upload` and Choose File, then select the theme's `.zip` file. Click Install Now.
3. Click <kbd>Activate</kbd> to use your new theme right away.
